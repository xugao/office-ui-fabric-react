 * The component is _____

 *
 * Additional considerations:
 *
 * The term "active" in css means that the keyboard or mouse button
 * which activates the component is pressed down. It is however ambiguous
 * with a focused state, as the HTML object model refers to the focused
 * element as the "activeElement". To resolve ambiguity and to be more
