# @fluentui/theme

**Theme components for [Fluent UI React](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/fluentui)**

These are not production-ready components and **should never be used in product**. This space is useful for testing new components whose APIs might change before final release.

To import Theme components:

```js
import { ComponentName } from '@fluentui/theme';
```
